# KK-multicopter-V5.5-with-Arduino-IDE

Found an OLD (crashed) KK Multicopter board and decided to have some fun with the onboard gyros and potentiometers.  
The board has an ATmega168PA that uses the internal 8MHz osc.

Modified the hardware by adding a Serial interface (FTDI) to enable communication with the Arduino IDE.
